# Ver. 0.1 The website was born
After using Wordpress for a year, I have decided to host my personal website on GitHub!

## Initiated the website
The website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).
