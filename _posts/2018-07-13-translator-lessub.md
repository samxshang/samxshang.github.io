I joined the Lessub Fansub Group as a translator and proofreader. I generated, translated, and proofread subtitles of LGBT+ and feminist documentaries and movies from English to Chinese.

Some of my services included:
- *"Olly Alexander: Growing Up Gay"* (2017)
- *"Miss Representation"* (2011)
- *"The Freedom to Marry"* (2016)
