# Ver. 0.1 The website was born
After using Wordpress for a year, I have decided to host my personal website on GitHub!

## Initiated the website
The website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).

First, I created a GitHub Pages repository to host my website: USERNAME.github.io

Second, I found the free website theme on [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/)

Third, I downloaded the theme files, and uploaded the files to my repository. Then I published my site. Voilà! I got a website up and running!

## Configuration and settings
Then, I made changes to the settings and personalized my site.

[X] _config.yml
[X] navigation.yml
