I'm currently researching cross-cultural judgment and decision making with [Dr. Li-Jun Ji](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/culture-and-cognition-lab/research-team) at Queen's University. Broadly, my research interests fall within the area of social cognitive psychology, including:
1. Judgment and decision making, communication strategy, misinformation, and false memory
2. Intergroup interaction, group identity and polarization, cross-cultural comparison of perception and communication, and the effects of stereotypes

# 2020 May
I'm currently researching bullshitting behavior (i.e. communication without concerns for evidence) with [Dr. John Petrocelli](http://petrocjv.sites.wfu.edu/). Broadly, my research interests fall within the area of social cognitive psychology, including:

1) Judgment and decision making, communication strategy, misinformation, and false memory
2) Intergroup interaction, group identity and polarization, cross-cultural comparison of perception and communication, and the effects of stereotypes
