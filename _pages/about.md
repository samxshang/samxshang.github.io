Hi visitor! Welcome to my website. This website is currently under construction.

## Research
I am a Social Cognitive Psychology researcher. I am a PhD student at the [Culture and Cognition lab](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/culture-and-cognition-lab/research-team) at Queen's University. I earned my B.S. in Applied Psychology from Jilin University in China and my [master's in Psychology](https://psychology.wfu.edu/graduate-program/) from Wake Forest University in the U.S.

I'm interested in cultural differences and similarities in perception, communication, and JDM. I am also enthusiastic about R, stats, and cross-cultural measurement.

## Personal
In my free time, I enjoy turning off screens, getting fresh air, and getting inspired by great minds, so I run while listening to my favorite podcasts. I also love recording my dreams. I have kept a dream diary since 2012.

My last name is the same as the Marvel superhero [*"Shang-Chi"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KDEdWbYYE0), and I named myself "Samantha" after the AI from the movie [*Her*](https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1211672857?ref_=vi_nxt_ap).

My name is Samantha Shang and I am a Techincal Research Coordinator working on the Wellbeing Assessment team. I graduated from Wake Forest University in 2020 with a Master's Degree in Psychology, and I received my Bachelor's degree from China. I am excited to work with everyone and use my skills to support the Wellbeing Assessment survey and research on student wellbeing in higher education. In my free time, I love watching sci-fi movies and playing with data. One fun fact about me is I picked my own English name after the AI from the movie Her.

# Previous research interests
I'm most interested in the unreliable side of human nature:
- When and why do we fall for misinformation? How do we detect misinformation?
- How were false memories formed?
- How do we correct and update the information we learned?
- How do biases and stereotypes affect intergroup interactions?

Other topics that I'm concerned with:
- Cross-cultural comparison of perception and communication
- Measurement invariance, increasing statistical power
-
